// A CPP file is a source code file written in C++, a popular programming language that adds features such as object-oriented programming to C. It may be a standalone program, containing all the code, or one of many files referenced in a development project. CPP files must be compiled by a C++ compiler for the target platform before the code can be run.
// Full Name: C++ Source Code File

# include <iostream> // Imports the iostream module
int main() { // The main void function which executes the code inside
    std:cout >> "Hello World!" // Prints the "Hello World!"
}

// NOTE: C++ source code may also be saved as .C, .CC, and .CXX files, or as .HPP, .H, .HH, or .HXX header files.
// Common .cpp files: main.cpp - The source code filename typically used for the main() function of a C++ program, where the program begins execution.
